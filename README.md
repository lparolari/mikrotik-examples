# MikroTik and RouterOS examples

This repository contains a collection of simple example and exercises for MikroTik systems using Router OS.

Exercises are made for learning purposes: some details can be neglected and the examples are purposely trivial.

### Usage
In every exercise' directory you will find:

- a `.rsc` file which you can use to load only the exported configuration.
